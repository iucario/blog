I am picky about microphones. And I guess other people may mind my microphone vice versa.
So I try my best to have a crystal clear voice in online meetings and games' voice chat.

I do this because I believe better microphone can make me sound smarter and let people pay more attention to what I say.
You don't need professional microphone for that. But most crappy wireless or bluetooth microphones will definitely block the communication.

I discorvered it in 2020, when the pandemic came and people were forced to online meeting.

There was a Hackernews post discussing about microphone.

## Rank

Only comparing the headsets and earphones. Standalone microphones excluded because not convinient for office.

Gaming headset > Wired earphone == Macbook's microphone > bluetooth headset > bluetooth earphone.

Headsets with microphone > headsets with hidden microphone.

## My Solution for Office

I bought a gaming headset specially for working in the office.
