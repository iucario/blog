# My first NAS

QNAP TS464C

What do I use it for?

Media server. Storage.
Not touching remote access now. I have no need for that.

I have not met a power outage ever in Japan for the past 4 years. So I don't worry much about power. I don't save valuable files only on NAS anyway. A UPS is not in urgent need.

## Why do I need a NAS?

One reason is the conflict between filename requirements for media server organization and seeding. It can be tedious to rename files in qBittorrent to meet Plex scanner rules. Itâ€™s time to separate seeding files and media server libraries.

On Windows, I can hard link files in batch to achieve this. But the command is a script in cmd.exe. On Linux and Mac symlink files are even easier. But I don't want to bother it. I need a large storage anyway.

## QNAP Terminal Commands

`uname -a`

`busybox`

`poweroff`
`reboot`
`free -m`

Why entware is being recommended? I can download softwares directly. What is the advantage?

## Script For Renaming Subtitle Files

Add `.chi` before `.srt` so that Plex can recognize these as Chinese subtitles

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.srt; do
  if [[ -e "$file" ]]; then
    # Rename the file by inserting .chi before .srt
    new_name="${file%.srt}.chi.srt"
    echo "Renaming '$file' to '$new_name'"
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
  fi
done

echo "Renaming complete!"
```
