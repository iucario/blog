QNAP TS464C

Bought from China. Can't believe the sum of price + shipping fee was still significantly cheaper than buying it in Japan.

What do I use it for?

Primarily as a media server and for storage.
Not touching remote access now. I don't need it.

As for UPS. I have not met a power outage ever in Japan for the past 4 years. So I don't worry much about power outages. I don't save valuable files only on NAS anyway. A UPS is not in urgent need.

## Why do I need a NAS?

One reason is the conflict between filename requirements for media server organization and seeding. It can be tedious to rename files in qBittorrent to meet Plex scanner rules. Itâ€™s time to separate seeding files and media server libraries.

On Windows, I can hard link files in batch to achieve this. But the command is a script in cmd.exe. On Linux and Mac symlink files are even easier. But I don't want to bother it. I need a large storage anyway.

## QNAP Terminal Commands

`uname -a`

`busybox`

`poweroff`
`reboot`
`free -m`

Why entware is being recommended? I can download softwares directly. What is the advantage?

## Installing Essentials

Download Python 3 and Oh my zsh from QNAP app center.

SSH to an admin account.

Follow the guide to enable Python. <https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/faq/article/how-to-run-python-3-on-the-nas>

I prefer more explicit commands:
```bash
_PYTHON3_QPKG_ROOT=$(/sbin/getcfg "Python3" Install_Path -f /etc/config/qpkg.conf)
_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN="${_PYTHON3_QPKG_ROOT}/opt/python3/bin"
/bin/ln -sf "${_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN}/python3" "${_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN}/python"

echo 'PATH=$PATH:'$_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN >> .zshrc
source .zshrc

python3 --version
```

Git and ZSH can be install from third party App repository: MyQNAP Repo.

Do remember to add `export TERM=XTERM` to `.zshrc`. Or the Backspace and many keys will not work. Seems to be some problem caused by colors.

## Script For Regex Renaming

An example of adding a ".chi" before ".srt" so that Plex can recognize them as Chinese subtitles.

`./rename.sh /tmp (.*).srt $1.chi.srt --dry-run`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to display usage
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 <directory> <regex_pattern> <output_pattern> [--dry-run | -d]"
    echo "  <directory>       The directory containing files to rename."
    echo "  <regex_pattern>   Regex pattern to extract parts of filenames."
    echo "  <output_pattern>  Output pattern for renaming files."
    echo "                    Use placeholders like \1, \2 for captured groups."
    echo "  --dry-run, -d     Preview the changes without renaming files."
    exit 1
}

# Check if at least three arguments are provided
if [ "$#" -lt 3 ]; then
    usage
fi

DIRECTORY="$1"
REGEX="$2"
OUTPUT_PATTERN="$3"
DRY_RUN=false

# Check for optional dry-run argument
if [ "$#" -eq 4 ]; then
    if [ "$2" == "--dry-run" ] || [ "$2" == "-d" ]; then
        DRY_RUN=true
    else
        usage
    fi
fi

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory $DIRECTORY does not exist."
    exit 1
fi


for FILE in "$DIRECTORY"/*.mp4; do
    # Extract parts using regex
    if [[ "$FILE" =~ $REGEX ]]; then
        NEW_NAME="$OUTPUT_PATTERN"

        # Replace $1, $2, etc., with captured groups
        for ((i=1; i<${#BASH_REMATCH[@]}; i++)); do
            NEW_NAME=${NEW_NAME//\$$i/${BASH_REMATCH[i]}}
        done
        
        if [ "$DRY_RUN" = true ]; then
            echo "Dry Run: rename '$FILE' to '$NEW_NAME'"
        else
            mv "$FILE" "$DIRECTORY/$NEW_NAME"
            echo "Renamed: $FILE -> $NEW_NAME"
        fi
    else
        echo "Filename does not match the expected pattern."
        exit 1
    fi
done
```
