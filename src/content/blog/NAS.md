QNAP TS464C

Bought from China. Can't believe the sum of price + shipping fee was still significantly cheaper than buying it in Japan.

What do I use it for?

Primarily as a media server and for storage.
Not touching remote access now. I don't need it.

As for UPS. I have not met a power outage ever in Japan for the past 4 years. So I don't worry much about power outages. I don't save valuable files only on NAS anyway. A UPS is not in urgent need.

## Why do I need a NAS?

One reason is the conflict between filename requirements for media server organization and seeding. It can be tedious to rename files in qBittorrent to meet Plex scanner rules.
Itâ€™s time to separate seeding files and media server libraries.

On Windows, I can hard link files in batch to achieve this. But the command is a script in cmd.exe.
On Linux and Mac symlink files are even easier. But I don't want to bother it. I need a large storage anyway.

## QNAP Terminal Commands

The commands are really limited. Even missing many essential tools.

Some handy commands:
`uname -a`
`busybox`
`poweroff`
`reboot`
`free -m`

Change mod to 755 for all folders in current directory. To hide the background colors of the folders copied from Windows.\
`find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +`

Why entware is being recommended? I can download softwares directly. What is the advantage?

## Installing Essentials

Download Python 3 and Oh my zsh from QNAP app center.

SSH to an admin account.

Follow the guide to enable Python.
<https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/faq/article/how-to-run-python-3-on-the-nas>

I prefer more explicit commands:

```bash
_PYTHON3_QPKG_ROOT=$(/sbin/getcfg "Python3" Install_Path -f /etc/config/qpkg.conf)
_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN="${_PYTHON3_QPKG_ROOT}/opt/python3/bin"
/bin/ln -sf "${_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN}/python3" "${_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN}/python"

echo 'PATH=$PATH:'$_PYTHON3_QPKG_BIN >> .zshrc
source .zshrc

python3 --version
```

Git and ZSH can be install from third party App repository: MyQNAP Repo.

Do remember to add `export TERM=XTERM` to `.zshrc`. Or the Backspace and many keys will not work. Seems to be some problem caused by colors.

## Script For Regex Renaming

With Python3 installed I can do a lot of things.

An example of adding a ".chi" before ".srt" so that Plex can recognize them as Chinese subtitles.

`python3 ~/rename.py /tmp '(.*).srt' '\1.chi.srt' --dry-run`

```py
import os
import re
import sys
import argparse

# Set up argument parser
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Rename files in a directory using regex and output pattern.")
parser.add_argument("directory", help="The directory containing files to rename.")
parser.add_argument("regex_pattern", help="Regex pattern to extract parts of filenames.")
parser.add_argument("output_pattern", help="Output pattern for renaming files, using placeholders like \\1, \\2.")
parser.add_argument("--dry-run", "-d", action="store_true", help="Preview the changes without renaming files.")

args = parser.parse_args()

# Assign arguments to variables
directory = args.directory
regex_pattern = args.regex_pattern
output_pattern = args.output_pattern
dry_run = args.dry_run

# Check if the directory exists
if not os.path.isdir(directory):
    print(f"Error: Directory {directory} does not exist.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Compile the regex pattern
try:
    regex = re.compile(regex_pattern)
except re.error as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid regex pattern. {e}")
    sys.exit(1)

# Iterate over files in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
    match = regex.match(filename)
    if match:
        try:
            new_name = re.sub(regex_pattern, output_pattern, filename)
        except re.error as e:
            print(f"Error in re.sub: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

        new_path = os.path.join(directory, new_name)

        if dry_run:
            print(f"Dry Run: rename '{file_path}' to '{new_path}'")
        else:
            os.rename(file_path, new_path)
            print(f"Renamed: {file_path} -> {new_path}")
```
