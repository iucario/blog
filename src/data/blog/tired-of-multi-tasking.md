I have been getting boring but requires-attention-caution operational tasks -- running some Hive queries for various client requests.

The tasks are usually ad-hoc. I have to understand the business requirements to modify or create queries. The tasks look very easy right?

However, running the queries on my company's hadoop cluster is a different situation. The in-house hadoop clusters are slow. There is no GUI. I have to be cautious logining in to production servers and double-check every command.
The operation is time-consuming and tiring. And only the operater would feel the much pain and understand the great effort in successfully complete such tasks.

I am not supposed to spend too much time on these operational tasks because I have another higher priority project ongoing to which I had **promised** to **commit wholy**.
But I end up taking all these tasks. Because the product managers, project mananers, my managers and everyone assigned the task to me _never_ estimated the scope and effort correctly!

There was one task to support QA testing our billing systems. The QA has title "Senior Engineer".
It was out of my scope. But I was assigned the task because I helped automating the execution of Hive queries for this project's billing system. I had no clue about the project nor it's billing systems. I was just the poor engineer who created an Airflow DAG.
I didn't anticipate what this QA test task would do to me at the beginning. I was asked to do a knowledge sharing with the QA. I wanted to escape in the middle of the meeting when the QA didn't know how to `cd ~`. I said "cd home" and the QA just typed `cd home`. There was a file that the QA wanted to download. The file was not large so both `scp` and copy-paste work. But the QA didn't know how to download the file from server. I told her `scp` but she refused to run it instead she asked me to download the file for her.
I should have noticed. I would be doing all the jobs for her.

I once had an evil thought deligating all the operational hive querying tasks to my mentee, a new graduate. I immediately rejected it in my mind because I realise I was doing the same kind of things bad people do, **pushing** _boring impactless_ tasks to poor junior engineers.

The hive query operatioal tasks are giving me PTSD. I cannot resist the disgust looking at the SQL files. Sometimes I felt so unfocused and tired that I open Slack and instantly forgot which thread I was heading to.
Multi-tasking is not a problem for me many of the times. I can work on multiple tasks that do not have tight deadlines or vague/changing requirements where I can work on my own pace and arrange slots for each tasks that suits me best.
But the level of multi-tasking I have been enduring is next level. I got a _senior_ QA who doesn't want to Google anything asking me the same questions over and over again. I would suddenly got _quick_ calls that could last over 1 hour. I got managers pushing the progress every day. I had another critical project that was supposed to be my main quest where some new tasks could be assigned to me.

Six months ago, I loved my job. One month ago, I could manage the pressure and balance it between self-learning.
Now I just feel so exhausted. Maybe this is what people called "burn out".
It created great damage to not only myself but people around me. I became unpatient for some trival questions. I started to doubt the collegues with bad intent. Some small things and words can trigger me.
