## Confluence Is Bad

Confluence is bad in so many ways.
I believe engineers would understand my points so I won't waste time here.

## Markdown Is Good

Less is more.

I like the simplicity and the ecosystem of Markdown.

Markdown files can be version-controled and formatted. The exact two attributes required for the source of technical documents.

## Markdown2conf

<https://github.com/iucario/markdown2conf>

Markdown2conf is using [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) as the parser. It outputs Confluence [wiki markup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-wiki-markup-251003035.html) by overwriting the Renderers of Marked.
