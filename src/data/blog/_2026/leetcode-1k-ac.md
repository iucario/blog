## Is Leetcode Useful

This July, I started practicing Leetcode again for my job hunting.

I don't know how much Leetcode will be helpful in job hunting in the future. People use AI even in interviews these days. Interviewers have probably adjusted their strategies accordingly.
However, solving LeetCode problems has become a daily habit. It helps me stay peaceful, especially when I am under the pressure of job hunting.

Solving problems always gives me a sense of satisfaction.
Will keep doing Leetcode. Hopefully I can keep up with the speed at which Leetcode updates its problems.

I will keep sharing knowledge in my blog. Check articles with tag [#algorithm](/tags/algorithm/)
